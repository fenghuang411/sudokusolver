sudokusolver
============
this project is an Android app developed in March 2014, it has a core algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle. 
this algorithm used be run in Python when first implemented by me, inorder to run this in app, I migrated it 
to Java. Nothing fancy, just backtracing to solve that, with additional data set to filter out impossible combinations,
so it's not just brute force !
This is the second Android app I've tried, first one was a simple caculator. so UI are just functional, no beauty at all.
latter I add some OCR to it and make it able to capture a image from cam and try to easy the way of inputting a puzzle.
the app is now avaiable at : http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iit.fenghuang.sudokusolver
